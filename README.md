An Experimental Rust Library for ABI Exploration

crabi_test is a Rust library designed to facilitate practical exploration and understanding of Application Binary Interface (ABI) concepts, particularly as they relate to cross-language interoperability and Rustâ€™s Foreign Function Interface (FFI).

<<<<<<< HEAD
Purpose
The library provides a set of simple, well-documented examples to illustrate how Rust can interact with other languages like C. By using features like #[repr(C)] for predictable memory layouts and extern "C" functions for FFI, crabi_test demonstrates the challenges and considerations involved in ABI compatibility.

Key Features
Data Structure Layouts: Examples of #[repr(C)] data structures to understand how Rust data can be made ABI-compliant. Cross-Language Function Calls: extern "C" functions that show how data is passed and modified between Rust and other languages. Practical Tests: Built-in tests to validate behavior and illustrate common pitfalls in ABI design and implementation.
